            Hello! Welcome to my capstone project, Cheap & Easy Auto! This is
            the only page that does not contain stateful information (for now).
            I have plans to make improvements to this site overtime. Currently,
            I'm a jr full-stack software developer open to work, so if you're
            hiring, please reach out! Filling out the contact form will send me
            an email. The made with love link in the footer directs to my
            LinkedIn.
